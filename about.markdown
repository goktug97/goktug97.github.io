Welcome to my personal website! My name is Göktuğ, and I am a software developer with a background in Electronics Engineering and Artificial Intelligence.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from Istanbul Technical University, where I gained a solid foundation in the field of electronics and developed an interest in programming. This led me to pursue a Master's degree in Computer Science at Freiburg University, where I focused on Artificial Intelligence and gained a deeper understanding of the field and its applications.

Currently, I am working as a software developer at Idealworks, where I am able to use my expertise in artificial intelligence to work on cutting-edge projects in the field of robotics.

I am always eager to learn, grow and contribute to the field of technology. Thank you for visiting my website and feel free to reach out to me with any questions.
